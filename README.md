# XSpacewar!™ 🚀
![Title](assets/logo.png)


## 🕹️ Game Overview
**XSpacewar!** is a modern tribute to the legendary **Spacewar!**, one of the very first video games ever created. Originally developed in 1962 by Steve Russell and fellow MIT pioneers, Spacewar! featured two spaceships battling in orbit around a central star, introducing groundbreaking concepts like gravity simulation and competitive multiplayer.

**XSpacewar!** captures that same pioneering spirit, reimagined with a retro-futuristic aesthetic inspired by 1960s sci-fi. Up to four spacecraft can engage in intense interstellar duels, with 2 to 4 players battling simultaneously. Use laser weapons, execute evasive maneuvers, and navigate a gravitational field that challenges every tactic. Designed for the **NKM T7000™** system.

## 🎮 Gameplay Preview

Players can enable or disable visual effects that emulate old CRT monitors, including:

- **Burn-in**: simulates the subtle image persistence caused by static elements.
- **Flickering**: recreates the intermittent screen flicker typical of cathode-ray displays.

These effects are designed to evoke a nostalgic atmosphere and can be toggled in the game settings.
